# React-native-chart-kit with persian lables and tooltips

<p>One of the main issues of React-native-chart-kit is that it is not supporting Persian and Arabic lables. The letters become separated and do not appear correctly. I made this project to show you how I solved this issue. I also added a feature to the chart which gives you the value of points clicked as a tooltip.</p>
